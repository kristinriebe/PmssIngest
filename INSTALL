Installation
------------

This code only works, if the DBIngestor is already installed!
(Download it from https://github.com/adrpar/DBIngestor.)

To compile, define DBINGESTOR_LIBRARY_PATH and DBINGESTOR_INCLUDE_PATH to
represent the installation directory of the DBIngestor library, e.g. like this:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DDBINGESTOR_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH=/usr/local/DBIngestor/lib -DDBINGESTOR_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/local/DBIngestor/include ..
make


Then you can call "PmssIngest" with command line parameters as given in the code.
See the README for an example.
